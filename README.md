# Quart Borg: Quarto slide theme for Reveal.js

This [Mork Borg](https://morkborg.com/)-inspired slide theme was built for 
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) users to build [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) 
slides with the color scheme from an unhealthily apocalyptic and metal tabletop 
role-playing game.

The theme started as a joke and got out of hand. See, I saw [Emil Hvitfeldt's 
posit::conf talk](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/talk-quarto-theming-positconf/#/section) 
on building custom slide templates and decided to try it out. Eventually the 
Mork Borg visual scheme came to mind and I had a good inner-laugh. And laughed 
some more. And started building it.

You have four versions of the theme to choose from:
  - `{.morkborg}`: Black on yellow
  - `{.grobkrom}`: Yellow on black (Get it? Because it's morkborg backwards?)
  - `{.cyborg}`: Black on pink
  - `{.grobyc}`: Pink on black (Really phoned in that name)

Each has a matching title slide style
  - `{.morkborg-title-slide}`
  - `{.grobkrom-title-slide}`
  - `{.cyborg-title-slide}`
  - `{.grobyc-title-slide}`

Now let's be perfectly clear: You really shouldn't use this template. It's 
actually quite jarring and obnoxious, but it's also still kind of tempting to 
show off.

But you shouldn't. I mean, it's not 100% colorblind friendly.

But you still wanna. Even though it could leave you or your audience with some 
eye strain.

Yet you're still considering using it. Do you hate this audience?

To apply a theme -- I can't believe you're seriously considering this -- append 
one of the above tags at the end of your slide title. Hit Render and it should 
show up.

## How to install

This [Quarto](https://quarto.org) extension can be installed against one's 
better judgment using the following command:

``` bash
quarto install extension morrisLuke/quart_borg
```

If you are unable to install Quarto extensions, you probably should [update Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

## How to use it

If you've gotten this far, I genuinely have to ask: Who hurt you?

After you install the template, use the following code on terminal to create a
new directory with all files needed:

``` bash
quarto use template morrisLuke/quart_borg
```

Then, please seek help.
